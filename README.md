*Self-Distilled Internet Photos (SDIP)* is a multi-domain image dataset. The dataset consists of *Self-Distilled Flickr (SD-Flickr)* and *Self-Distilled LSUN (SD-LSUN)* that were crawled from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and [LSUN dataset](https://www.yf.io/p/lsun), respectively, and then curated using the method described in our Self-Distilled StyleGAN paper:
